## üî¨ Research Statement

My doctoral research investigates the intricate relationship between physiological arousal, cognitive effort, and the integrity of the human brain's neuromodulatory systems. I am fundamentally interested in understanding *why* cognitive performance, particularly in aging, becomes vulnerable under demanding real-world conditions.

My work aims to move beyond simple behavioral metrics by integrating psychophysics, pupillometry, and computational modeling to deconstruct the subcomponents of decision-making. By precisely measuring the impact of physical and cognitive load, I seek to build predictive models of performance that can inform the design of safer, more adaptive, and more inclusive technologies for a range of user populations.

##  Core Research Areas

My research program is built on four interconnected pillars:

* **Aging & Cognitive Neuroscience:** Characterizing how age-related changes in the Locus Coeruleus (LC) and its associated neural circuits impact cognitive functions, with a focus on identifying potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders.
* **Dual-Task Interference & Performance:** Quantifying how concurrent physical and cognitive stressors interact to impair performance across multiple domains, including perception, memory, and metacognition.
* **Applied Human Factors:** Translating cognitive science insights to real-world high-stakes environments (aerospace, healthcare, manufacturing) to enhance safety and performance through data-driven design.
* **Personalized Cognitive Modeling:** Moving beyond group averages to model how individual differences in factors like Cognitive Reserve predict a person's unique resilience to cognitive overload.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodological Expertise

To address these questions, I specialize in a multi-modal approach to data collection and analysis:

* **Psychophysics:** Designing and implementing precise behavioral experiments to measure perceptual and memory thresholds (PsychToolbox).
* **Pupillometry:** Using pupil dilation as a real-time, non-invasive biomarker of cognitive load and physiological arousal (MATLAB, R, Python).
* **Machine Learning:** Developing predictive models for cognitive state classification using ensemble methods (XGBoost), feature engineering, and cross-validation techniques.
* **Computational Modeling:** Applying models like the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to deconstruct decision-making processes.
* **Advanced Statistical Analysis:** Employing linear mixed-effects models and Bayesian methods for complex, repeated-measures data (R).
* **Neuroimaging:** Analyzing Diffusion MRI data to investigate white matter integrity and its relationship to behavior (FSL, QSIPrep).
* **Real-Time Analytics:** Building interactive dashboards and monitoring systems for applied research contexts (R Shiny, web technologies).

## üéØ Current Research Focus

**PhD Dissertation (2025):** *"A Psychophysiological Approach to Modeling Dual-Task Interference: Pupillometry, Cognitive Reserve, and Personalized Performance Prediction"*

This research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for predicting when and why individuals experience cognitive overload in dual-task scenarios, with applications to aging, technology design, and occupational safety.
