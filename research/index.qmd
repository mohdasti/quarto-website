## Research Overview

My research in the Seitz Lab investigates how variations in the Locus Coeruleus (LC) influence perception and memory in older adults. This work aims to identify potential biomarkers and interventions for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.

## Current Projects

### LC Integrity and Cognitive Function in Aging
The primary research program employs advanced MRI techniques and psychophysical assessments to characterize how LC integrity moderates behavior, focusing on:
- Auditory and visual perception
- Visual memory consolidation
- Metacognitive efficiency
- Age-related cognitive differences

### Ongoing Studies
1. **Behavioral Analysis of Older Adults**
   - Analyzing psychometric functions and pupillometry
   - Correlating with neuroimaging metrics
   
2. **Metacognitive Efficiency Analysis**
   - Comparing younger and older adults
   - Focusing on auditory and visual perceptual tasks
