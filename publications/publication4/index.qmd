## Abstract

Background: Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte disorder where serum Na +
Concentration is >145 mM, and is frequently identified as an issue in patients admitted
under general internal medicine 1,2
. The etiology can generally be classified as loss of free
water or decreased intake, iatrogenic ingestion/infusion of hypertonic solution, or pseudohypernatremia
3
. It is a common practice to assume decreased intake of free water or
extrarenal free water loss as the etiology, and to treat the hypernatremia with administration
of hypotonic crystalloid solution without investigation of serum or urine osmolality,
electrolytes, urea, or creatinine to delineate etiology 3,4
. In particular, the two
often neglected diagnoses are diabetes insipidus and osmotic-induced diuresis. Etiology of
hypernatremia is occasionally elusive and refractory to administration of crystalloid solution.
However, laboratory investigations ordered by clinicians to properly determine underlying
etiology of hypernatremia in these cases are not routine and may vary significantly.
Objectives: We hypothesized that appropriate ordering of serum and urine studies by
clinicians to determine the etiology of hypernatremia is related to the severity of
hypernatremia. In addition, we aim to determine the etiology of hypernatremia that trigger
clinician ordering of serum/urine studies.
Methods: Patients admitted under general internal medicine at hospitals affiliated with the
University Health Network (Toronto Western Hospital and Toronto General Hospital)
between the dates of 2015 and 2019 with a serum sodium concentration of 150 mmol/L or
greater were selected and assessed for completion of serum electrolytes, serum osmolality,
urine electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), urine osmolality, urine creatinine, and urine urea. Discharge
summaries were analysed to determine etiology and treatment of hypernatremia as well as
treatments initiated. The research proposal was approved by Coordinated Approval
Process for Clinical Research (CAPCR) at the University Health Network.
Results: Based on our preliminary results, we were able to identify 606 cases of admitted
general internal medicine patients with hypernatremia meeting our criteria. In our
preliminary analysis of 47 cases, we were able to identify 18 cases (38.3%) with serum
osmolality, 19 cases (40.4%) with urine osmolality, 23 cases (48.9%) with urine electrolytes,
1 case (2.1%) with urine urea, and 1 case (2.1%) with urine creatinine. There were 11
cases (23.4%) with all of serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine electrolytes. In
general, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number additional
investigations ordered beyond serum electrolytes (ie. serum osmolality and urine studies; r 2
= 0.0204).
Conclusion: In this study of patients with hypernatremia we found that a significant portion
of admitted patients were not evaluated for urine studies, especially urea or creatinine.
Unexpectedly, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number of studies
ordered to determine etiology, suggesting that the severity of hypernatremia may play a
minor role in clinician ordering habits in hypernatremia. The current study signifies the
importance of proper ordering and understanding of pathophysiology of hypernatremia and
could contribute to filling the knowledge gap in appropriate ordering in hypernatremia, which
may reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of hypernatremic patients.
