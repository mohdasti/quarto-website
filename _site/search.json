My work sits at the intersection of psychology and technology, where I use a multi-modal approach to deconstruct the hidden cognitive processes behind human behavior.\nMy core research focuses on how factors like aging, physical stress, and physiological arousal impact our ability to perceive, learn, and remember. To get at the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind performance, I go beyond simple behavioral metrics, specializing in methodologies like pupillometry to get a real-time, objective measure of cognitive load and computational modeling to isolate the subcomponents of decision-making.\nMy goal is to translate these deep scientific insights into practical applications.

    "section": "",
    "text": "üß† Optimizing Learning: A Deep Dive into the Cognitive States that Boost Memory\n\n\nüìä Executive Summary / TL;DR\n\nThe Problem: Companies build tools to help users learn and be productive but lack clarity on how different mental states (like napping or meditating) influence the brain‚Äôs ability to retain factual versus physical memories. This uncertainty can result in inefficiencies, diminished user performance, and wasted investments in training programs or wellness initiatives.\nMy Action: I designed and executed an end-to-end research study involving 60+ participants, employing a mixed-methods approach with behavioral tasks (word-pair recall, a physical maze game), physiological EEG recordings, and self-report questionnaires.\nThe Result: I discovered that mindfulness meditation significantly improved factual memory retention. The most surprising discovery was that while naps are restorative, deep sleep can temporarily impair physical skills due to sleep inertia‚Äîa critical insight for products or services targeting immediate post-rest performance.\n\n\n\n\nüéØ The Business Problem / The Challenge\nProduct teams in e-learning, corporate training, and wellness often design experiences without clear evidence on how users‚Äô cognitive states impact their ability to learn. Is a power nap or meditation more effective for mastering a new software skill or physical task? This study addressed these questions by exploring how rest, naps, and meditation specifically influence:\n\nDeclarative Memory: Crucial for retaining facts and information.\nProcedural Memory: Essential for acquiring new physical skills.\n\n\n\n\nüßë‚Äçüî¨ My Role & Responsibilities\n\nLead Researcher: Oversaw the entire research process from ideation to completion.\nProject Manager: Scoped the study, managed timelines, coordinated 60+ participants over multiple sessions, and ensured seamless execution.\nMentor & Team Lead: Guided and trained a team of three student researchers (including one undergraduate capstone project) on experimental protocols, data collection techniques, and research ethics.\nResearch Designer: Developed the research protocols, memory task stimuli, and selected EEG hardware and analytical tools.\nData Scientist: Performed all data preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced statistical analyses utilizing R and Bayesian methodologies.\nCommunicator: Presented findings clearly to interdisciplinary stakeholders and authored a peer-reviewed perspective piece, translating complex results into actionable recommendations for the broader scientific community.\n\n\n\n\nüî¨ The Approach: A 3-Phase Process\nPhase 1: Research Design & User Recruitment\n\nWhat I did: Structured a three-condition experiment (Nap, Meditation, Active Wakefulness) conducted over multiple days.\nWhy I did it: Enabled clear comparisons among cognitive states, minimizing confounding variables like anxiety through the multi-day design.\nWhat I did: Established precise participant screening criteria (e.g., must be habitual meditators/nappers).\nWhy I did it: Ensured genuine representation of targeted cognitive states, enhancing the validity and applicability of the results.\n\nPhase 2: Mixed-Methods Data Collection\n\nBehavioral Data: I chose word-pair and marble-maze tasks. These tasks distinctly measured factual recall (declarative) and motor skill acquisition (procedural), aligning with the study‚Äôs dual-memory focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marble maze apparatus used to measure procedural motor skill learning.\n\n\n\nPhysiological Data: I collected multi-channel EEG recordings. This objective physiological data captured precise cognitive states, surpassing the reliability of self-report alone.\nSelf-Report Data: I administered validated scales (ESS, FMI). This added subjective insights into the participant experience, complementing the objective EEG data.\n\nPhase 3: Analysis & Synthesis\n\nProcessed and visually scored hours of multi-channel EEG data, epoch by epoch, to objectively classify sleep stages and identify ‚Äòmeditative states.‚Äô\nUtilized Bayesian statistical modeling in R, which is optimal for reliable interpretation, particularly with smaller, nuanced datasets.\nEmployed a G-Mean calculation for declarative memory analysis to handle class imbalance in the test data, ensuring unbiased accuracy of results.\n\n\n\n\nüí° Key Insight #1: For learning facts, quiet focus beats a nap.\n\nWhat I Found: Mindfulness meditators showed a significant advantage in memory retention over participants in an active-waking state (watching a video). Furthermore, their performance trended higher than those who took a short nap, suggesting that for factual learning, quiet wakefulness is a powerful and reliable tool for memory consolidation.\nThe ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù: Quiet, focused wakefulness is optimal for factual learning, suggesting intentional meditation breaks could greatly enhance retention of new information.\nPotential Application: Companies like Duolingo, Coursera, or even corporate onboarding programs could integrate structured, guided meditation intervals into training modules to boost user learning and long-term retention of educational content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance on the declarative memory task was highest in the Meditation (MED) group.\n\n\n\n\n\nüí° Key Insight #2: Deep naps can temporarily hurt physical skills.\n\nWhat I Found: Participants experiencing only light sleep improved their motor skills, while those entering deep Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) experienced post-nap performance impairments, attributed to sleep inertia.\nThe ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù: The depth of a nap critically influences post-rest performance on physical tasks. For users needing immediate peak performance, an unintended deep nap could be counterproductive.\nPotential Application: Smartwatch companies (like Apple or Google/Fitbit) developing smart alarm features could optimize wake-up times to avoid interrupting SWS. This feature would be critical for roles requiring immediate alertness and precision post-rest, such as shift workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, or drivers in logistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance on the maze task improved with more light sleep (pink line) but worsened with more deep sleep (blue line), highlighting the impact of sleep inertia.\n\n\n\n\n\nüöß Challenges & Learnings\n\nChallenge 1: Validating a Novel Task. The marble maze was a new method for assessing procedural memory.\n\nWhat I Learned: This taught me the importance of assessing the criterion validity of new research instruments. In a future iteration, I would correlate its results with a well-established motor skills task to build a stronger case for its reliability.\n\nChallenge 2: Unbalanced Demographics. The exploratory analysis revealed that gender might influence performance on different memory types, but the sample was not balanced for this comparison.\n\nWhat I Learned: This experience underscored the value of user segmentation. Going forward, I would proactively balance demographic cells in my recruiting plans, adopting a more iterative, UX-oriented approach to confidently analyze how different user groups might behave.\n\n\n\n\n\nüìö Publications & Impact\nThe insights from this research were not only compelling but also sparked a broader conversation in the scientific community. The work led directly to a peer-reviewed publication in a leading journal, demonstrating its scientific rigor and relevance:\n\nPeer-Reviewed Publication:\n\nDastgheib, M., Kulanayagam, A., & Dringenberg, H.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantial empirical evidence suggests that sleep benefits the consolidation and reorganization of learned information. Consequently, the concept of ‚Äúsleep-dependent memory consolidation‚Äù is now widely accepted by the scientific community, in addition to influencing public perceptions regarding the functions of sleep. There are, however, numerous studies that have presented findings inconsistent with the sleep-memory hypothesis. Here, we challenge the notion of ‚Äúsleep-dependency‚Äù by summarizing evidence for effective memory consolidation independent of sleep. Plasticity mechanisms thought to mediate or facilitate consolidation during sleep (e.g., neuronal replay, reactivation, slow oscillations, neurochemical milieu) also operate during non-sleep states, particularly quiet wakefulness, thus allowing for the stabilization of new memories. We propose that it is not sleep per se, but the engagement of plasticity mechanisms, active during both sleep and (at least some) waking states, that constitutes the critical factor determining memory formation. Thus, rather than playing a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù role, sleep falls along a continuum of behavioral states that vary in their effectiveness to support memory consolidation at the neural and behavioral level.\n\n\n\nView Publication (DOI) Download PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Coverage\n\n\n\nCuriosity Daily Podcast (Discovery) Episode: Daydream Brain, Power of a Laugh, Caffeine & Soccer Original release: Jan 25, 2024 ¬∑ Re-release: Dec 19, 2024\n\n\nListen on Acast\n\nThe Boston Globe: Five facts about sleep everyone should know\nThe Harvard Gazette: Researchers one step closer to understanding daydreams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Background: Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte disorder where serum Na + Concentration is &gt;145 mM, and is frequently identified as an issue in patients admitted under general internal medicine 1,2 . The etiology can generally be classified as loss of free water or decreased intake, iatrogenic ingestion/infusion of hypertonic solution, or pseudohypernatremia 3 . It is a common practice to assume decreased intake of free water or extrarenal free water loss as the etiology, and to treat the hypernatremia with administration of hypotonic crystalloid solution without investigation of serum or urine osmolality, electrolytes, urea, or creatinine to delineate etiology 3,4 . In particular, the two often neglected diagnoses are diabetes insipidus and osmotic-induced diuresis. Etiology of hypernatremia is occasionally elusive and refractory to administration of crystalloid solution. However, laboratory investigations ordered by clinicians to properly determine underlying etiology of hypernatremia in these cases are not routine and may vary significantly. Objectives: We hypothesized that appropriate ordering of serum and urine studies by clinicians to determine the etiology of hypernatremia is related to the severity of hypernatremia. In addition, we aim to determine the etiology of hypernatremia that trigger clinician ordering of serum/urine studies. Methods: Patients admitted under general internal medicine at hospitals affiliated with the University Health Network (Toronto Western Hospital and Toronto General Hospital) between the dates of 2015 and 2019 with a serum sodium concentration of 150 mmol/L or greater were selected and assessed for completion of serum electrolytes, serum osmolality, urine electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), urine osmolality, urine creatinine, and urine urea. Discharge summaries were analysed to determine etiology and treatment of hypernatremia as well as treatments initiated. The research proposal was approved by Coordinated Approval Process for Clinical Research (CAPCR) at the University Health Network. Results: Based on our preliminary results, we were able to identify 606 cases of admitted general internal medicine patients with hypernatremia meeting our criteria. In our preliminary analysis of 47 cases, we were able to identify 18 cases (38.3%) with serum osmolality, 19 cases (40.4%) with urine osmolality, 23 cases (48.9%) with urine electrolytes, 1 case (2.1%) with urine urea, and 1 case (2.1%) with urine creatinine. There were 11 cases (23.4%) with all of serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine electrolytes. In general, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number additional investigations ordered beyond serum electrolytes (ie. serum osmolality and urine studies; r 2 = 0.0204). Conclusion: In this study of patients with hypernatremia we found that a significant portion of admitted patients were not evaluated for urine studies, especially urea or creatinine. Unexpectedly, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number of studies ordered to determine etiology, suggesting that the severity of hypernatremia may play a minor role in clinician ordering habits in hypernatremia. The current study signifies the importance of proper ordering and understanding of pathophysiology of hypernatremia and could contribute to filling the knowledge gap in appropriate ordering in hypernatremia, which may reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of hypernatremic patients."

    "section": "",
    "text": "üöÄ The Vision: From Post-Op Review to Proactive Support\n\n‚ÄúDuring my time as an AI Annotator at Surgical Safety Technologies (SST), I had a firsthand view of how their groundbreaking ‚ÄòOR Black Box‚Äô captures the complex dynamics of the operating room to improve patient outcomes. This experience solidified my understanding of the immense value in data-driven clinical insights. It also highlighted the next critical frontier: moving beyond analyzing what happened to understanding the surgeon‚Äôs cognitive state‚Äîthe why behind their actions.‚Äù\n\nThis project is the direct result of that insight. It‚Äôs a proof-of-concept for a ‚ÄúCognitive Black Box‚Äù‚Äîa system designed to predict a surgeon‚Äôs cognitive state in real-time. By fusing my PhD research on the cognitive neuroscience of effort with my industry experience, this case study demonstrates a tangible solution for moving from post-operative review to proactive, intraoperative support, enhancing both patient safety and surgeon well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mockup of a surgical console screen displaying a time-series plot of the surgeon‚Äôs pupil dilation and grip force variability, indicating their cognitive state during a procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† The Scientific Framework: My Research in Action\n[cite_start]This project is an application of my PhD research, which provides the theoretical engine to model the underlying mechanisms of performance degradation under pressure[cite: 1, 317].\n\nResource Competition TheoryNeural Gain Theory (NGT)\n\n\n[cite_start]This framework explains what happens when a surgeon performs a physically demanding action (like sustained retraction, mirroring my 40% MVC research) while making a high-stakes cognitive judgment[cite: 78, 244]. These tasks compete for the same finite pool of mental resources. My model is designed to detect when this competition leads to performance-impairing cognitive overload.\n\n\nNGT provides the physiological why. [cite_start]The brain‚Äôs arousal system (specifically the LC-NE system) acts like a ‚Äúvolume knob,‚Äù adjusting neural gain to enhance important signals and suppress noise[cite: 107, 108]. [cite_start]My research shows that under the high combined effort typical of surgery, this system can become dysregulated, a phenomenon I can model and predict using pupillometry as a direct, non-invasive biomarker of this process[cite: 298, 301].\n Caption: The inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance, central to NGT. [cite_start]My system is designed to identify when a surgeon moves past the optimal point and into a state of impaired performance due to excessive cognitive load[cite: 111, 120].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚öôÔ∏è The Machine Learning Pipeline: From Raw Data to Actionable Insight\nI designed an end-to-end pipeline to simulate and process multimodal data, engineer theoretically-grounded features, and train a predictive model.\n\n1. Data Simulation2. Feature Engineering3. Modeling & Explainability (XAI)\n\n\nTo build this proof-of-concept, I simulated a realistic, second-by-second data stream from a multi-hour laparoscopic procedure. The dataset includes: - Physiological Data: pupil_diameter_mm, heart_rate_variability_rmssd - Motor Control Data: grip_force_newtons - Contextual Data: surgical_phase (e.g., ‚ÄúDissection‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuturing‚Äù), physical_effort_level (‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù) - Target Variable: cognitive_state_ground_truth (‚ÄúOptimal‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh Load‚Äù, ‚ÄúFatigued‚Äù, ‚ÄúAttentional Lapse‚Äù)\n\n\nThis is where my domain expertise becomes critical. I created novel, theory-driven features: - [cite_start]tonic_pupil_level: A rolling average of pupil diameter, reflecting baseline arousal and overall cognitive load[cite: 114]. - [cite_start]phasic_pupil_response: An event-related dilation metric, reflecting the brain‚Äôs adaptive gain response to critical surgical events[cite: 114]. - grip_force_variability: A novel metric I developed for this project. It calculates the rolling standard deviation of instrument grip force, based on my hypothesis that increased variability serves as a proxy for attentional lapses.\n\n\nI trained an XGBoost Classifier‚Äîan industry-standard, high-performance model‚Äîto predict the surgeon‚Äôs cognitive state. To ensure the model is interpretable and trustworthy for clinical stakeholders, I used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the key predictive features.\n[Placeholder for your Feature Importance Plot from the XGBoost model]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ú® The Result: A Real-Time Analytics Dashboard\nThe final output is a proof-of-concept dashboard built in R Shiny. It simulates a live view of the surgeon‚Äôs cognitive state and provides clear, interpretable alerts.\n[Placeholder for a full screenshot of your Shiny App Dashboard]\nKey Features of the Dashboard:\n\nLive Cognitive State Prediction: Displays the model‚Äôs primary output (e.g., Optimal, High Load, Attentional Lapse) with a corresponding confidence score.\nMulti-Modal Data Visualization: Shows synchronized, live-updating streams of physiological (pupil) and motor (grip force) data.\nExplainable Alerts: The most innovative feature is the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù panel. When an alert is triggered, the dashboard uses the XAI model to explain which data signals are driving the prediction, building trust and providing actionable context.\n\n[Placeholder for a GIF showing an alert being triggered and the ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô panel updating]\n\n\n\nüìö Artifacts & Next Steps\n\nGitHub Repository: View the full source code for the simulation, modeling pipeline, and Shiny app. (Suggestion: create a new repo for this project)\nGrant Proposal: Read the full, peer-reviewed research proposal that provides the theoretical foundation for this work.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
