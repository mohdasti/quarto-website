    "title": "The Surgeon’s ‘Cognitive Black Box’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "🚀 The Vision: From Post-Op Review to Proactive Support\n\n“During my time as an AI Annotator at Surgical Safety Technologies (SST), I had a firsthand view of how their groundbreaking ‘OR Black Box’ captures the complex dynamics of the operating room to improve patient outcomes. This experience solidified my understanding of the immense value in data-driven clinical insights. It also highlighted the next critical frontier: moving beyond analyzing what happened to understanding the surgeon’s cognitive state—the why behind their actions.”\n\nThis project is my answer to that challenge. I developed a proof-of-concept for a “Cognitive Black Box”—an end-to-end analytics platform that predicts a surgeon’s cognitive state in real-time. By fusing my PhD research on the cognitive neuroscience of effort with my industry experience, this case study demonstrates a tangible solution for moving from post-operative review to proactive, intraoperative support, enhancing both patient safety and surgeon well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mockup of a surgical console screen displaying a time-series plot of the surgeon’s pupil dilation and grip force variability, indicating their cognitive state during a procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 The Scientific Framework: My Research in Action\nThis project is an application of my PhD research, which provides the theoretical engine to model the underlying mechanisms of performance degradation under pressure.\n\nAdaptive Gain Theory (AGT)Resource Competition TheoryKey Concepts & Terminology\n\n\nAGT provides the physiological why. The brain’s arousal system (specifically the LC-NE system) acts like a “volume knob,” adjusting neural gain to enhance important signals and suppress noise. My research shows that under the high combined effort typical of surgery, this system can become dysregulated, a phenomenon I can model and predict using pupillometry as a direct, non-invasive biomarker of this process.\n Caption: The inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance, central to Adaptive Gain Theory. My system is designed to identify when a surgeon moves past the optimal point and into a state of impaired performance due to excessive cognitive load.\n\n\nThis framework explains what happens when a surgeon performs a physically demanding action (like sustained retraction, mirroring my 40% MVC research) while making a high-stakes cognitive judgment. These tasks compete for the same finite pool of mental resources. My model is designed to detect when this competition leads to performance-impairing cognitive overload.\n\n\nA brief glossary of the core concepts from my research that power this project.\n\nPupillometry: The measurement of pupil diameter. I use it as a precise, non-invasive biomarker of cognitive effort and arousal, as it is tightly linked to activity in the brain’s Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine (LC-NE) system.\nTonic vs. Phasic Arousal: These are two distinct modes of the arousal system that I model with my features:\n\nTonic Arousal (tonic_pupil_level_30s): Refers to the slow-moving, baseline level of alertness over a longer period (tens of seconds). It reflects the surgeon’s overall engagement and processing load.\nPhasic Arousal (phasic_pupil_change_5s): Refers to the rapid, transient bursts of arousal in response to a specific event (e.g., making a critical suture). It reflects the momentary deployment of focused mental effort.\n\nGrip Force Variability (grip_force_variability_15s): A novel feature I engineered for this project. It’s based on the hypothesis that maintaining a steady isometric muscle contraction requires constant attentional control. Therefore, an increase in the variability (i.e., noise) of the grip force signal can serve as a proxy for a lapse in sustained attention.\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): The machine learning algorithm I chose for the classification task. It is a high-performance, industry-standard model known for its accuracy and its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in data.\nFeature Engineering: The process of transforming raw sensor data into meaningful variables that machine learning algorithms can use effectively. My domain expertise in cognitive neuroscience guided the creation of theory-driven features rather than generic statistical measures.\nCross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning: Rigorous methods to ensure model reliability. Cross-validation tests the model on unseen data subsets, while hyperparameter tuning optimizes the model’s configuration for best performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚙️ The Machine Learning Pipeline: From Raw Data to Actionable Insight\nI designed an end-to-end pipeline to simulate and process multimodal data, engineer theoretically-grounded features, and train a predictive model.\n\n1. Data Simulation2. Feature Engineering3. Modeling & Explainability (XAI)\n\n\nTo build this proof-of-concept, I simulated a realistic, second-by-second data stream from a 3-hour surgical procedure. The dataset includes:\n\nPhysiological Data: pupil_diameter_mm - continuous pupillometry measurements\nMotor Control Data: grip_force_newtons - surgical instrument grip pressure\nBehavioral Data: instrument_tremor_hz- high-frequency tremor measurements\n\nTarget Variable: cognitive_state (“Optimal”, “High Load”, “Fatigued”, “Attentional Lapse”)\n\nThe simulation creates 32,400 observations (3 surgeons × 10,800 seconds) with realistic temporal dynamics and state transitions based on surgical workflow patterns.\n\n\nThis is where my domain expertise becomes critical. I created novel, theory-driven features:\n\ntonic_pupil_level_30s: A 30-second rolling average of pupil diameter, reflecting baseline arousal and overall cognitive load.\nphasic_pupil_change_5s: An event-related dilation metric capturing rapid pupil changes from a 5-second baseline, reflecting the brain’s adaptive gain response to critical surgical events.\ngrip_force_variability_15s: A novel metric I developed for this project. It calculates the 15-second rolling standard deviation of instrument grip force, based on my hypothesis, grounded in dual-task literature, that increased variability in fine motor control serves as a proxy for attentional lapses.\ntremor_trend_10s: A 10-second rolling mean of instrument tremor, capturing fine motor control degradation.\npupil_diameter_lag_5s: Temporal context feature providing the pupil state from 5 seconds prior.\n\n\n\nI trained an XGBoost Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using 3-fold cross-validation—an industry-standard, high-performance model—to predict the surgeon’s cognitive state. The model achieves:\n\nOverall Accuracy: 99.58%\nCohen’s Kappa: 0.993\nCross-Validation: Robust performance across folds with grid search optimization\n\nTo ensure the model is interpretable and trustworthy for clinical stakeholders, I implemented feature importance analysis and dynamic explanations that show which physiological signals are driving each prediction in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature importance from the trained XGBoost model showing the relative predictive power of each engineered feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✨ The Result: A Real-Time Analytics Dashboard\nThe final output is a proof-of-concept dashboard built in R Shiny. It simulates a live view of the surgeon’s cognitive state and provides clear, interpretable alerts with two main interfaces:\n\nLive Surgical DashboardML Model Diagnostics\n\n\nThe primary interface provides real-time monitoring during surgery with an intuitive, clinical-focused design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Surgical Dashboard showing real-time pupil diameter and grip force monitoring with cognitive state prediction and dynamic clinical interpretations.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\nReal-time sensor plots: Pupil diameter and grip force visualized with human-readable time formatting\nCognitive state spectrum: Dynamic dial showing current state on a visual spectrum\nProgress tracking: Video-style progress bar with accurate time remaining\nDynamic “Why” panel: Data-driven clinical interpretations that update based on live feature values\nSpeed controls: Simulation can run at 1x, 10x, 50x, or 100x speed for demos\n\n\n\nThe technical interface provides transparency into the machine learning model’s decision-making process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nML Model Diagnostics panel showing prediction probabilities, live feature values, and feature importance visualization.\n\n\nTechnical Features:\n\nPrediction probabilities: Live confidence scores for all four cognitive states\nFeature values table: Real-time display of all engineered features driving predictions\nFeature importance: Static visualization showing which features matter most to the model\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Highlight: Data-Driven Explanations The most innovative feature is the dynamic “Why” panel that doesn’t just show generic text, but reports the actual feature values driving each prediction (e.g., “High Grip Force Variability (2.31 N)” or “Elevated Tonic Pupil Level (4.2 mm)”), building trust through transparency.\n\n\n\n🚀 Applications: Enhancing the da Vinci Surgical System\nThe true power of this research is its direct applicability to high-stakes environments. While the methodology is versatile, this case study focuses on a specific, high-impact application: enhancing the capabilities of Intuitive’s da Vinci surgical systems.\nThe da Vinci platform provides unparalleled robotic control and visualization but currently lacks objective, real-time monitoring of the surgeon’s cognitive state. My “Cognitive Black Box” is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing da Vinci ecosystem to fill this critical gap, transforming the surgeon’s console into a cognitively-aware command center.\n\n🏥 High-Stakes Medicine: The Cognitively-Aware Surgical Console\nProblem: A surgeon’s performance can be compromised by fatigue and high cognitive load long before they are consciously aware of it. The da Vinci system logs instrument data, but it cannot see the surgeon’s mental state.\nMy Solution: Integrate my real-time cognitive state analytics directly into the da Vinci surgeon console.\n1. Integration with the Surgeon Console Viewfinder:\n\nExisting Feature: The da Vinci surgeon console provides a high-definition, 3D view of the surgical site.\nMy Enhancement: I propose a minimalist Heads-Up Display (HUD) overlay at the edge of the viewfinder. This HUD would display a simple, color-coded Cognitive State Indicator (CSI). It would remain a calm green during “Optimal” states, turn yellow during “High Load,” and provide a subtle, non-distracting red pulse during a predicted “Attentional Lapse.” This provides critical feedback without diverting the surgeon’s focus.\n\n2. Leveraging da Vinci’s Built-in Data Streams:\n\nExisting Feature: Da Vinci systems can already record instrument and event data. My work at SST involved annotating this type of procedural video data.\nMy Enhancement: My system would tap into these existing data streams. The grip_force_variability feature I developed would be calculated directly from the force sensors in the master controllers (the surgeon’s hand controls). The phasic_pupil_response would be timed to critical events logged by the system, such as instrument activation or error alerts. This isn’t a new set of sensors; it’s a smarter use of the data already being generated.\n\n3. Enhancing Post-Operative Debriefing with “Simulated Eye View”:\n\nExisting Feature: Intuitive provides products like the “Simulated Eye View” for post-operative review and training.\nMy Enhancement: I propose augmenting these recordings with a synchronized timeline of the surgeon’s predicted cognitive state. Trainees could see exactly when and why a period of high cognitive load occurred, correlating it with specific surgical steps. The “Why” panel from my dashboard would provide objective, data-driven talking points for the debriefing session, moving beyond subjective recall.\n\n\n\n\n\n📚 Project Artifacts & Technical Details\n\nCode & RepositoryModel PerformanceResearch Foundation\n\n\n\nGitHub Repository: View the complete source code, data pipeline, and interactive dashboard\nTech Stack: R, Shiny, XGBoost, tidyverse, ggplot2, DT\nDevelopment Approach: Modular pipeline with separate scripts for data simulation, feature engineering, and model training\nReproducibility: All code includes seed setting and comprehensive logging for transparent replication\n\n\n\nTraining Results:\n\nDataset: 32,400 observations across 3 simulated surgeons\nFeatures: 5 engineered features from 3 raw sensor streams\nAlgorithm: XGBoost with 3-fold cross-validation hyperparameter tuning\nAccuracy: 99.58% overall accuracy with κ = 0.993\n\nPer-Class Performance:\n\nOptimal State: 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity\nHigh Load: 99.9% sensitivity, 100% specificity\n\nFatigued: 99.9% sensitivity, 99.4% specificity\nAttentional Lapse: 25% sensitivity, 100% specificity*\n\nAttentional lapses are rare events (0.4% prevalence), where high specificity is prioritized to avoid false alarms.\n\n\n\nGrant Proposal: Read the peer-reviewed research proposal providing the theoretical foundation\nIndustry Context: Inspired by work as AI Annotator at Surgical Safety Technologies (SST)\nAcademic Integration: Direct application of PhD research on cognitive neuroscience of effort and Adaptive Gain Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Impact & Next Steps\nImmediate Applications:\n\nSurgical Training: Objective assessment of trainee cognitive load during skill development, reducing time-to-proficiency and identifying trainees who may require additional support\nQuality Improvement: Data-driven insights into when and why surgical performance degrades, potentially reducing intraoperative errors by flagging high-risk cognitive states\nResearch Platform: Foundational system for studying cognitive load in high-stakes environments\n\nFuture Development:\n\nHardware Integration: Connect with real pupillometry and force sensor systems\nClinical Validation: Partner with surgical training centers for real-world testing\n\nMulti-Modal Expansion: Incorporate additional physiological signals I have experience with, such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV), EEG, and cortisol\nTeam Monitoring: Extend to monitor multiple team members simultaneously\n\nThis proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of real-time cognitive monitoring in surgical environments, bridging fundamental neuroscience research with practical clinical applications.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "🧠 Optimizing Learning: A Deep Dive into the Cognitive States that Boost Memory\n\n\n📊 Executive Summary / TL;DR\n\nThe Problem: Companies build tools to help users learn and be productive but lack clarity on how different mental states (like napping or meditating) influence the brain’s ability to retain factual versus physical memories. This uncertainty can result in inefficiencies, diminished user performance, and wasted investments in training programs or wellness initiatives.\nMy Action: I designed and executed an end-to-end research study involving 60+ participants, employing a mixed-methods approach with behavioral tasks (word-pair recall, a physical maze game), physiological EEG recordings, and self-report questionnaires.\nThe Result: I discovered that mindfulness meditation significantly improved factual memory retention. The most surprising discovery was that while naps are restorative, deep sleep can temporarily impair physical skills due to sleep inertia—a critical insight for products or services targeting immediate post-rest performance.\n\n\n\n\n🎯 The Business Problem / The Challenge\nProduct teams in e-learning, corporate training, and wellness often design experiences without clear evidence on how users’ cognitive states impact their ability to learn. Is a power nap or meditation more effective for mastering a new software skill or physical task? This study addressed these questions by exploring how rest, naps, and meditation specifically influence:\n\nDeclarative Memory: Crucial for retaining facts and information.\nProcedural Memory: Essential for acquiring new physical skills.\n\n\n\n\n🧑‍🔬 My Role & Responsibilities\n\nLead Researcher: Oversaw the entire research process from ideation to completion.\nProject Manager: Scoped the study, managed timelines, coordinated 60+ participants over multiple sessions, and ensured seamless execution.\nMentor & Team Lead: Guided and trained a team of three student researchers (including one undergraduate capstone project) on experimental protocols, data collection techniques, and research ethics.\nResearch Designer: Developed the research protocols, memory task stimuli, and selected EEG hardware and analytical tools.\nData Scientist: Performed all data preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced statistical analyses utilizing R and Bayesian methodologies.\nCommunicator: Presented findings clearly to interdisciplinary stakeholders and authored a peer-reviewed perspective piece, translating complex results into actionable recommendations for the broader scientific community.\n\n\n\n\n🔬 The Approach: A 3-Phase Process\nPhase 1: Research Design & User Recruitment\n\nWhat I did: Structured a three-condition experiment (Nap, Meditation, Active Wakefulness) conducted over multiple days.\nWhy I did it: Enabled clear comparisons among cognitive states, minimizing confounding variables like anxiety through the multi-day design.\nWhat I did: Established precise participant screening criteria (e.g., must be habitual meditators/nappers).\nWhy I did it: Ensured genuine representation of targeted cognitive states, enhancing the validity and applicability of the results.\n\nPhase 2: Mixed-Methods Data Collection\n\nBehavioral Data: I chose word-pair and marble-maze tasks. These tasks distinctly measured factual recall (declarative) and motor skill acquisition (procedural), aligning with the study’s dual-memory focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marble maze apparatus used to measure procedural motor skill learning.\n\n\n\nPhysiological Data: I collected multi-channel EEG recordings. This objective physiological data captured precise cognitive states, surpassing the reliability of self-report alone.\nSelf-Report Data: I administered validated scales (ESS, FMI). This added subjective insights into the participant experience, complementing the objective EEG data.\n\nPhase 3: Analysis & Synthesis\n\nProcessed and visually scored hours of multi-channel EEG data, epoch by epoch, to objectively classify sleep stages and identify ‘meditative states.’\nUtilized Bayesian statistical modeling in R, which is optimal for reliable interpretation, particularly with smaller, nuanced datasets.\nEmployed a G-Mean calculation for declarative memory analysis to handle class imbalance in the test data, ensuring unbiased accuracy of results.\n\n\n\n\n💡 Key Insight #1: For learning facts, quiet focus beats a nap.\n\nWhat I Found: Mindfulness meditators showed a significant advantage in memory retention over participants in an active-waking state (watching a video). Furthermore, their performance trended higher than those who took a short nap, suggesting that for factual learning, quiet wakefulness is a powerful and reliable tool for memory consolidation.\nThe “So What?”: Quiet, focused wakefulness is optimal for factual learning, suggesting intentional meditation breaks could greatly enhance retention of new information.\nPotential Application: Companies like Duolingo, Coursera, or even corporate onboarding programs could integrate structured, guided meditation intervals into training modules to boost user learning and long-term retention of educational content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance on the declarative memory task was highest in the Meditation (MED) group.\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Key Insight #2: Deep naps can temporarily hurt physical skills.\n\nWhat I Found: Participants experiencing only light sleep improved their motor skills, while those entering deep Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) experienced post-nap performance impairments, attributed to sleep inertia.\nThe “So What?”: The depth of a nap critically influences post-rest performance on physical tasks. For users needing immediate peak performance, an unintended deep nap could be counterproductive.\nPotential Application: Smartwatch companies (like Apple or Google/Fitbit) developing smart alarm features could optimize wake-up times to avoid interrupting SWS. This feature would be critical for roles requiring immediate alertness and precision post-rest, such as shift workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, or drivers in logistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance on the maze task improved with more light sleep (pink line) but worsened with more deep sleep (blue line), highlighting the impact of sleep inertia.\n\n\n\n\n\n🚧 Challenges & Learnings\n\nChallenge 1: Validating a Novel Task. The marble maze was a new method for assessing procedural memory.\n\nWhat I Learned: This taught me the importance of assessing the criterion validity of new research instruments. In a future iteration, I would correlate its results with a well-established motor skills task to build a stronger case for its reliability.\n\nChallenge 2: Unbalanced Demographics. The exploratory analysis revealed that gender might influence performance on different memory types, but the sample was not balanced for this comparison.\n\nWhat I Learned: This experience underscored the value of user segmentation. Going forward, I would proactively balance demographic cells in my recruiting plans, adopting a more iterative, UX-oriented approach to confidently analyze how different user groups might behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n📚 Publications & Impact\nThe insights from this research were not only compelling but also sparked a broader conversation in the scientific community. The work led directly to a peer-reviewed publication in a leading journal, demonstrating its scientific rigor and relevance:\n\nPeer-Reviewed Publication:\n\nDastgheib, M., Kulanayagam, A., & Dringenberg, H.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background: Hypernatremia is a common electrolyte disorder where serum Na + Concentration is &gt;145 mM, and is frequently identified as an issue in patients admitted under general internal medicine 1,2 . The etiology can generally be classified as loss of free water or decreased intake, iatrogenic ingestion/infusion of hypertonic solution, or pseudohypernatremia 3 . It is a common practice to assume decreased intake of free water or extrarenal free water loss as the etiology, and to treat the hypernatremia with administration of hypotonic crystalloid solution without investigation of serum or urine osmolality, electrolytes, urea, or creatinine to delineate etiology 3,4 . In particular, the two often neglected diagnoses are diabetes insipidus and osmotic-induced diuresis. Etiology of hypernatremia is occasionally elusive and refractory to administration of crystalloid solution. However, laboratory investigations ordered by clinicians to properly determine underlying etiology of hypernatremia in these cases are not routine and may vary significantly. Objectives: We hypothesized that appropriate ordering of serum and urine studies by clinicians to determine the etiology of hypernatremia is related to the severity of hypernatremia. In addition, we aim to determine the etiology of hypernatremia that trigger clinician ordering of serum/urine studies. Methods: Patients admitted under general internal medicine at hospitals affiliated with the University Health Network (Toronto Western Hospital and Toronto General Hospital) between the dates of 2015 and 2019 with a serum sodium concentration of 150 mmol/L or greater were selected and assessed for completion of serum electrolytes, serum osmolality, urine electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), urine osmolality, urine creatinine, and urine urea. Discharge summaries were analysed to determine etiology and treatment of hypernatremia as well as treatments initiated. The research proposal was approved by Coordinated Approval Process for Clinical Research (CAPCR) at the University Health Network. Results: Based on our preliminary results, we were able to identify 606 cases of admitted general internal medicine patients with hypernatremia meeting our criteria. In our preliminary analysis of 47 cases, we were able to identify 18 cases (38.3%) with serum osmolality, 19 cases (40.4%) with urine osmolality, 23 cases (48.9%) with urine electrolytes, 1 case (2.1%) with urine urea, and 1 case (2.1%) with urine creatinine. There were 11 cases (23.4%) with all of serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine electrolytes. In general, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number additional investigations ordered beyond serum electrolytes (ie. serum osmolality and urine studies; r 2 = 0.0204). Conclusion: In this study of patients with hypernatremia we found that a significant portion of admitted patients were not evaluated for urine studies, especially urea or creatinine. Unexpectedly, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number of studies ordered to determine etiology, suggesting that the severity of hypernatremia may play a minor role in clinician ordering habits in hypernatremia. The current study signifies the importance of proper ordering and understanding of pathophysiology of hypernatremia and could contribute to filling the knowledge gap in appropriate ordering in hypernatremia, which may reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of hypernatremic patients."

In our preliminary analysis of 47 cases, we were able to identify 18 cases (38.3%) with serum osmolality, 19 cases (40.4%) with urine osmolality, 23 cases (48.9%) with urine electrolytes, 1 case (2.1%) with urine urea, and 1 case (2.1%) with urine creatinine. There were 11 cases (23.4%) with all of serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine electrolytes. In general, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number additional investigations ordered beyond serum electrolytes (ie. serum osmolality and urine studies; r 2 = 0.0204). Conclusion: In this study of patients with hypernatremia we found that a significant portion of admitted patients were not evaluated for urine studies, especially urea or creatinine. Unexpectedly, the severity of hypernatremia correlated poorly with the number of studies ordered to determine etiology, suggesting that the severity of hypernatremia may play a minor role in clinician ordering habits in hypernatremia. The current study signifies the importance of proper ordering and understanding of pathophysiology of hypernatremia and could contribute to filling the knowledge gap in appropriate ordering in hypernatremia, which may reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of hypernatremic patients."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstantial empirical evidence suggests that sleep benefits the consolidation and reorganization of learned information. Consequently, the concept of “sleep-dependent memory consolidation” is now widely accepted by the scientific community, in addition to influencing public perceptions regarding the functions of sleep. There are, however, numerous studies that have presented findings inconsistent with the sleep-memory hypothesis. Here, we challenge the notion of “sleep-dependency” by summarizing evidence for effective memory consolidation independent of sleep. Plasticity mechanisms thought to mediate or facilitate consolidation during sleep (e.g., neuronal replay, reactivation, slow oscillations, neurochemical milieu) also operate during non-sleep states, particularly quiet wakefulness, thus allowing for the stabilization of new memories. We propose that it is not sleep per se, but the engagement of plasticity mechanisms, active during both sleep and (at least some) waking states, that constitutes the critical factor determining memory formation. Thus, rather than playing a “critical” role, sleep falls along a continuum of behavioral states that vary in their effectiveness to support memory consolidation at the neural and behavioral level.\n\n\n\nView Publication (DOI) Download PDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia Coverage\n\n\n\nCuriosity Daily Podcast (Discovery) Episode: Daydream Brain, Power of a Laugh, Caffeine & Soccer Original release: Jan 25, 2024 · Re-release: Dec 19, 2024\n\n\nListen on Acast\n\nThe Boston Globe: Five facts about sleep everyone should know\nThe Harvard Gazette: Researchers one step closer to understanding daydreams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

That’s why we calibrate per trainee.\n“Adaptive gain” is the mechanism (LC-NE modulating neural gain) that can yield this non-monotonic performance curve.\n\nReferences. Yerkes–Dodson (1908); Aston-Jones & Cohen (2005, adaptive gain).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-axis: a z-scored, signed evidence index from biosignals (e.g., TEPR↑, RMSSD↓).\nHigher → High-Load; lower → Lapse.\n\n\nWhat this shows.

This policy adjusts decision criteria (bias), not d′.\n\nHow the two figures relate: The first figure defines the boundaries (enter/exit on each side). The second applies the same boundaries—nudged slightly if needed so at least one crossing is visible—to a noisy signal, showing how hysteresis prevents flip-flops near a boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHysteresis. Enter/exit thresholds (and/or consecutive-sample confirmation) require persistent evidence to change state—reducing nuisance alerts.\nMaps to Dashboard. The control sets the HL and Lapse thresholds together. Alerts still require evidence + physiology (e.g., HL requires TEPR↑ or HRV↓; Lapse prefers low TEPR + blink anomalies).\nReferences. Macmillan & Creelman (Signal Detection Theory); NASA-TLX background (Hart & Staveland).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow to read this policy\n\nPre-onset (t &lt; 30 min): the decision threshold stays at 0.70.\nPost-onset: the threshold relaxes exponentially toward the floor 0.50—i.e., the system becomes more tolerant of High-Load detections as vigilance degrades.\nMicrobreak (t = 60 min): a small reset tightens the threshold, then decays over ~2 min. (Demo uses a fixed, modest reset.)\nHalf-life: at t = onset + half-life = 30 + 21 = 51 min, the threshold sits halfway between 0.70 and 0.50.\nDesign intent: this is a controller on the criterion—transparent, auditable, and tunable per surgeon/task; it does not assume the evidence itself drifts.\n\n\n\n\nWhy a policy like this? Vigilance typically declines with time-on-task while perceived workload rises; brief microbreaks improve comfort and focus without harming flow. Pupil/HRV often show fast, partial recovery over 1–3 minutes. A time-scheduled, small criterion reset captures these operational realities without heavy modeling.\nGood defaults (to be tuned): onset_min 20–30 min; fatigue_half_life_min 15–30 min; reset proportional to observed pre/post microbreak recovery, with decay 1–3 min.\nReferences.\n\nWarm, Parasuraman & Matthews (2008).

    "title": "The Surgeon’s ‘Cognitive Black Box’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "🚀 The Vision: From Post-Op Review to Proactive Support\n\n“During my time as an AI Annotator at Surgical Safety Technologies (SST), I had a firsthand view of how their groundbreaking ‘OR Black Box’ captures the complex dynamics of the operating room to improve patient outcomes. This experience solidified my understanding of the immense value in data-driven clinical insights. It also highlighted the next critical frontier: moving beyond analyzing what happened to understanding the surgeon’s cognitive state—the why behind their actions.”\n\nThis project is my answer to that challenge. I developed a proof-of-concept for a “Cognitive Black Box”—an end-to-end analytics platform that predicts a surgeon’s cognitive state in real-time. By fusing my PhD research on the cognitive neuroscience of effort with my industry experience, this case study demonstrates a tangible solution for moving from post-operative review to proactive, intraoperative support, enhancing both patient safety and surgeon well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mockup of a surgical console screen displaying a time-series plot of the surgeon’s pupil dilation and grip force variability, indicating their cognitive state during a procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 The Scientific Framework: My Research in Action\nThis project is an application of my PhD research, which provides the theoretical engine to model the underlying mechanisms of performance degradation under pressure.\n\nAdaptive Gain Theory (AGT)Resource Competition TheoryKey Concepts & Terminology\n\n\nAGT provides the physiological why. The brain’s arousal system (specifically the LC-NE system) acts like a “volume knob,” adjusting neural gain to enhance important signals and suppress noise. My research shows that under the high combined effort typical of surgery, this system can become dysregulated, a phenomenon I can model and predict using pupillometry as a direct, non-invasive biomarker of this process.\n Caption: The inverted-U relationship between arousal and performance, central to Adaptive Gain Theory. My system is designed to identify when a surgeon moves past the optimal point and into a state of impaired performance due to excessive cognitive load.\n\n\nThis framework explains what happens when a surgeon performs a physically demanding action (like sustained retraction, mirroring my 40% MVC research) while making a high-stakes cognitive judgment. These tasks compete for the same finite pool of mental resources. My model is designed to detect when this competition leads to performance-impairing cognitive overload.\n\n\nA brief glossary of the core concepts from my research that power this project.\n\nPupillometry: The measurement of pupil diameter. I use it as a precise, non-invasive biomarker of cognitive effort and arousal, as it is tightly linked to activity in the brain’s Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine (LC-NE) system.\nTonic vs. Phasic Arousal: These are two distinct modes of the arousal system that I model with my features:\n\nTonic Arousal (tonic_pupil_level_30s): Refers to the slow-moving, baseline level of alertness over a longer period (tens of seconds). It reflects the surgeon’s overall engagement and processing load.\nPhasic Arousal (phasic_pupil_change_5s): Refers to the rapid, transient bursts of arousal in response to a specific event (e.g., making a critical suture). It reflects the momentary deployment of focused mental effort.\n\nGrip Force Variability (grip_force_variability_15s): A novel feature I engineered for this project. It’s based on the hypothesis that maintaining a steady isometric muscle contraction requires constant attentional control. Therefore, an increase in the variability (i.e., noise) of the grip force signal can serve as a proxy for a lapse in sustained attention.\nXGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): The machine learning algorithm I chose for the classification task. It is a high-performance, industry-standard model known for its accuracy and its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in data.\nFeature Engineering: The process of transforming raw sensor data into meaningful variables that machine learning algorithms can use effectively. My domain expertise in cognitive neuroscience guided the creation of theory-driven features rather than generic statistical measures.\nCross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning: Rigorous methods to ensure model reliability. Cross-validation tests the model on unseen data subsets, while hyperparameter tuning optimizes the model’s configuration for best performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚙️ The Machine Learning Pipeline: From Raw Data to Actionable Insight\nI designed an end-to-end pipeline to simulate and process multimodal data, engineer theoretically-grounded features, and train a predictive model.\n\n1. Data Simulation2. Feature Engineering3. Modeling & Explainability (XAI)\n\n\nTo build this proof-of-concept, I simulated a realistic, second-by-second data stream from a 3-hour surgical procedure. The dataset includes:\n\nPhysiological Data: pupil_diameter_mm - continuous pupillometry measurements\nMotor Control Data: grip_force_newtons - surgical instrument grip pressure\nBehavioral Data: instrument_tremor_hz- high-frequency tremor measurements\n\nTarget Variable: cognitive_state (“Optimal”, “High Load”, “Fatigued”, “Attentional Lapse”)\n\nThe simulation creates 32,400 observations (3 surgeons × 10,800 seconds) with realistic temporal dynamics and state transitions based on surgical workflow patterns.\n\n\nThis is where my domain expertise becomes critical. I created novel, theory-driven features:\n\ntonic_pupil_level_30s: A 30-second rolling average of pupil diameter, reflecting baseline arousal and overall cognitive load.\nphasic_pupil_change_5s: An event-related dilation metric capturing rapid pupil changes from a 5-second baseline, reflecting the brain’s adaptive gain response to critical surgical events.\ngrip_force_variability_15s: A novel metric I developed for this project. It calculates the 15-second rolling standard deviation of instrument grip force, based on my hypothesis, grounded in dual-task literature, that increased variability in fine motor control serves as a proxy for attentional lapses.\ntremor_trend_10s: A 10-second rolling mean of instrument tremor, capturing fine motor control degradation.\npupil_diameter_lag_5s: Temporal context feature providing the pupil state from 5 seconds prior.\n\n\n\nI trained an XGBoost Classifier with hyperparameter tuning using 3-fold cross-validation—an industry-standard, high-performance model—to predict the surgeon’s cognitive state. The model achieves:\n\nOverall Accuracy: 99.58%\nCohen’s Kappa: 0.993\nCross-Validation: Robust performance across folds with grid search optimization\n\nTo ensure the model is interpretable and trustworthy for clinical stakeholders, I implemented feature importance analysis and dynamic explanations that show which physiological signals are driving each prediction in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature importance from the trained XGBoost model showing the relative predictive power of each engineered feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✨ The Result: A Real-Time Analytics Dashboard\nThe final output is a proof-of-concept dashboard built in R Shiny. It simulates a live view of the surgeon’s cognitive state and provides clear, interpretable alerts with two main interfaces:\n\nLive Surgical DashboardML Model Diagnostics\n\n\nThe primary interface provides real-time monitoring during surgery with an intuitive, clinical-focused design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Surgical Dashboard showing real-time pupil diameter and grip force monitoring with cognitive state prediction and dynamic clinical interpretations.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\nReal-time sensor plots: Pupil diameter and grip force visualized with human-readable time formatting\nCognitive state spectrum: Dynamic dial showing current state on a visual spectrum\nProgress tracking: Video-style progress bar with accurate time remaining\nDynamic “Why” panel: Data-driven clinical interpretations that update based on live feature values\nSpeed controls: Simulation can run at 1x, 10x, 50x, or 100x speed for demos\n\n\n\nThe technical interface provides transparency into the machine learning model’s decision-making process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nML Model Diagnostics panel showing prediction probabilities, live feature values, and feature importance visualization.\n\n\nTechnical Features:\n\nPrediction probabilities: Live confidence scores for all four cognitive states\nFeature values table: Real-time display of all engineered features driving predictions\nFeature importance: Static visualization showing which features matter most to the model\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Highlight: Data-Driven Explanations The most innovative feature is the dynamic “Why” panel that doesn’t just show generic text, but reports the actual feature values driving each prediction (e.g., “High Grip Force Variability (2.31 N)” or “Elevated Tonic Pupil Level (4.2 mm)”), building trust through transparency.\n\n\n\n🚀 Applications: Enhancing the da Vinci Surgical System\nThe true power of this research is its direct applicability to high-stakes environments. While the methodology is versatile, this case study focuses on a specific, high-impact application: enhancing the capabilities of Intuitive’s da Vinci surgical systems.\nThe da Vinci platform provides unparalleled robotic control and visualization but currently lacks objective, real-time monitoring of the surgeon’s cognitive state. My “Cognitive Black Box” is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing da Vinci ecosystem to fill this critical gap, transforming the surgeon’s console into a cognitively-aware command center.\n\n🏥 High-Stakes Medicine: The Cognitively-Aware Surgical Console\nProblem: A surgeon’s performance can be compromised by fatigue and high cognitive load long before they are consciously aware of it. The da Vinci system logs instrument data, but it cannot see the surgeon’s mental state.\nMy Solution: Integrate my real-time cognitive state analytics directly into the da Vinci surgeon console.\n1. Integration with the Surgeon Console Viewfinder:\n\nExisting Feature: The da Vinci surgeon console provides a high-definition, 3D view of the surgical site.\nMy Enhancement: I propose a minimalist Heads-Up Display (HUD) overlay at the edge of the viewfinder. This HUD would display a simple, color-coded Cognitive State Indicator (CSI). It would remain a calm green during “Optimal” states, turn yellow during “High Load,” and provide a subtle, non-distracting red pulse during a predicted “Attentional Lapse.” This provides critical feedback without diverting the surgeon’s focus.\n\n2. Leveraging da Vinci’s Built-in Data Streams:\n\nExisting Feature: Da Vinci systems can already record instrument and event data. My work at SST involved annotating this type of procedural video data.\nMy Enhancement: My system would tap into these existing data streams. The grip_force_variability feature I developed would be calculated directly from the force sensors in the master controllers (the surgeon’s hand controls). The phasic_pupil_response would be timed to critical events logged by the system, such as instrument activation or error alerts. This isn’t a new set of sensors; it’s a smarter use of the data already being generated.\n\n3. Enhancing Post-Operative Debriefing with “Simulated Eye View”:\n\nExisting Feature: Intuitive provides products like the “Simulated Eye View” for post-operative review and training.\nMy Enhancement: I propose augmenting these recordings with a synchronized timeline of the surgeon’s predicted cognitive state. Trainees could see exactly when and why a period of high cognitive load occurred, correlating it with specific surgical steps. The “Why” panel from my dashboard would provide objective, data-driven talking points for the debriefing session, moving beyond subjective recall.\n\n\n\n\n\n📚 Project Artifacts & Technical Details\n\nCode & RepositoryModel PerformanceResearch Foundation\n\n\n\nGitHub Repository: View the complete source code, data pipeline, and interactive dashboard\nTech Stack: R, Shiny, XGBoost, tidyverse, ggplot2, DT\nDevelopment Approach: Modular pipeline with separate scripts for data simulation, feature engineering, and model training\nReproducibility: All code includes seed setting and comprehensive logging for transparent replication\n\n\n\nTraining Results:\n\nDataset: 32,400 observations across 3 simulated surgeons\nFeatures: 5 engineered features from 3 raw sensor streams\nAlgorithm: XGBoost with 3-fold cross-validation hyperparameter tuning\nAccuracy: 99.58% overall accuracy with κ = 0.993\n\nPer-Class Performance:\n\nOptimal State: 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity\nHigh Load: 99.9% sensitivity, 100% specificity\n\nFatigued: 99.9% sensitivity, 99.4% specificity\nAttentional Lapse: 25% sensitivity, 100% specificity*\n\nAttentional lapses are rare events (0.4% prevalence), where high specificity is prioritized to avoid false alarms.\n\n\n\nGrant Proposal: Read the peer-reviewed research proposal providing the theoretical foundation\nIndustry Context: Inspired by work as AI Annotator at Surgical Safety Technologies (SST)\nAcademic Integration: Direct application of PhD research on cognitive neuroscience of effort and Adaptive Gain Theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Impact & Next Steps\nImmediate Applications:\n\nSurgical Training: Objective assessment of trainee cognitive load during skill development, reducing time-to-proficiency and identifying trainees who may require additional support\nQuality Improvement: Data-driven insights into when and why surgical performance degrades, potentially reducing intraoperative errors by flagging high-risk cognitive states\nResearch Platform: Foundational system for studying cognitive load in high-stakes environments\n\nFuture Development:\n\nHardware Integration: Connect with real pupillometry and force sensor systems\nClinical Validation: Partner with surgical training centers for real-world testing\n\nMulti-Modal Expansion: Incorporate additional physiological signals I have experience with, such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV), EEG, and cortisol\nTeam Monitoring: Extend to monitor multiple team members simultaneously\n\nThis proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of real-time cognitive monitoring in surgical environments, bridging fundamental neuroscience research with practical clinical applications.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

In both cases, sustained physical load collides with high cognitive demands—and performance can slip.”\n\nIn high-stakes environments, understanding the precise point where a user becomes overwhelmed is critical for safety and efficiency. This case study outlines the research roadmap I designed to objectively measure and predict cognitive overload, moving beyond guesswork to create data-driven solutions for safer, more adaptive systems.\nThe framework combines controlled physical stressors (isometric handgrip), a battery of cognitive tasks, and real-time physiological biomarkers (pupillometry) to deconstruct how performance degrades under real-world pressure."
